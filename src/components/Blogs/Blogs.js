            What is the purpose of react router?

            React Router is a standard library for routing in
            React. It enables the navigation among views of various components
            in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps
            the UI in sync with the URL. Let us create a simple application to
            React to understand how the React Router works. The application will
            contain three components: home component, about a component, and
            contact component. We will use React Router to navigate between
            these components.

            As with most component-based frontend frameworks, passing some form
            of data from one component to another is usually a real need.
            Typically it comes in the form of passing data from a parent to a
            child component or even child to parent components. This leads to
            components having data they donâ€™t actually need, but they need to
            pass on down the tree. This gets cumbersome pretty fast especially
            for certain types of props .

            The useRef hook is the new addition in React 16.8. Before proceeding
            to this article there is a prerequisite to know about the ref in
            react. The useRef is a hook that allows to directly create a
            reference to the DOM element in the functional component.{" "}
